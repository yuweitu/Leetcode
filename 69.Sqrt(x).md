## 69. Sqrt(x)

### **Description**

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```



### **Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    """
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
    # 2500 ms
        if x <= 1:
            return x
        
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            if i*i > x:
                return i - 1
            elif i*i == x:
                return i
            else:
                continue
    """
    
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
    # 40 ms
        if x <= 1:
            return x
        
        start, end = 1, x
        
        # start + 1 < end, binary search template, think about why start <+ end will cause endless loop 
        while start +1 < end:  
            mid = (start + end) // 2  
            # a//b: Floor Division - The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed
            if mid * mid < x:
                start = mid
            elif mid * mid > x:
                end = mid
            else:
                return mid
        return start
