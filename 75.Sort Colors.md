## 75. Sort Colors

### **Description**

Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
  First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

### **Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        if not nums or len(nums) == 0:
            return

        # three pointers
        left, current, right = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
        # left represent the end of 0, current is iterative, rigth represent the start of 2
        
        while current <= right:
            if nums[current] == 0:
                nums[left], nums[current] = nums[current], nums[left]
                left += 1
                current += 1
            elif nums[current] == 2:
                nums[current], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[current]
                right -= 1
                # current += 1  # 易错：此处不能向前进！！！！！！
            else:
                current += 1
        return
                
```
